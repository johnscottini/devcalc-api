# devcalc-api
The goal of this project is to practice CI/CD pipelines, to accomplish that, I created a simple springboot app with math operations and JUNIT tests.

The build tool chosen is Spring, because of the facility to create and run a web application.

To execute the application locally, select the Main Class on the run configurations and use the API.

I created a pipeline to execute the unit tests and also build the project
